# Fraud-Detection-In-Transactions

## Objective 
The Fraud detection model build using machine learning techniques XGBoost classifier. 
The stes implemented are given as follows:
- Data Loading Initial analysis
- Exploratory data analysis 
- Data preprocessing-dealing with missing values, outliers, multi-collinerity
- Feature engineering-creating derived features for better determination
- Model selection -selecting features for model prediction, model training and prediction.
- Evaluation of model with ROC Curve, accurcy , pprecision, auc etc.
- Dealing with model effectiveness for fraud detection.
